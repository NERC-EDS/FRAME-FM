# notebooks/

Jupyter notebooks for exploration, demos, and tutorials.

Recommended usage:
- Keep notebooks small and focused (single topic per notebook)
- Prefer importing from `src/FRAME_FM/` rather than duplicating logic in notebooks
- Treat notebooks as *examples*, not the source of truth for pipelines
