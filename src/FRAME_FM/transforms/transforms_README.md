# transforms

A location for all our transformation classes and relevant utilities to 
glue them to our framework.

Additionally we may support transforms from other tools/systems, e.g.:

- `anemoi-transform`: https://anemoi.readthedocs.io/projects/transform/en/latest/: 
- `torchvision.transformsi`: https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/transforms.html
