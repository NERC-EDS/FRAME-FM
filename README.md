## Environment Setup from `pyproject.toml`
### 🚀 Setting Up the Environment (from pyproject.toml)

This project uses **uv** for dependency management.  
If you already have the repository (including `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`), use the steps below to recreate the full environment.

## 1. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 2. Install dependencies with uv

```bash
pip install uv
uv sync
```

## 3. Add Additional Dependencies
Additional sources, such as `torchgeo` are installable sperately - so as to reduce wasting storage.

To install them, either run the relevant `uv add` command such as:
```bash
uv add torchgeo
```
OR you can install all sources using the `data_requirements.txt`
```bash
uv pip install -r data_requirements.txt
```
